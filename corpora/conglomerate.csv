My 16th Birthday ruined by my family,"I'm in a similar situation and I know how hard it is. My family is Serbian, but out of all the families here, mine is definitely the most dysfunctional.

My parents argue 24/7, all my dad does is criticize me and yell at me. He expects me to not have a life and do everything single little thing that pops into his mind. I get no affection and growing-up in such a shitty household kinda killed my confidence and self-esteem from being talked down to and called a ""konj"" or ""bik.""

My dad and my grandma don't really know any English so I have to do everything for them. My dad and his late dad smoke all the time. Literally everything smells like cigarettes. My dad's a workaholic and he is always working on something and I get dragged into it, and if I don't help him because I have my own life at this point, he will yell at me and get super mad.

Honestly, my best advice is to just wait it out til you're 18, get a job, and try renting a condo with some friends to get away from all the negativity. That's my plan. I still respect my family, but I just can't stand living with them. Hopefully, moving-out will reduce the negative things you deal with everyday and fix your relationship with your family."

It really explains up close a scary aspect of the digitalized world. Yes, we all knew it is there, it happens and it‚Äôs not good, but this makes one realize it could happen to anyone and it might not end well for anyone.

This reminds me of a plan I thought of some time ago.
The plan was to lure 10 or 15 of those guys to the same spot with about 15 minutes apart. Then I‚Äôd call the police and tell them they‚Äôd be able to arrest several predators in a short time, with chats, emails and maybe pictures to hold against them.

"IQ ""changed"" by 50 points in 14 years","I don't support homeschooling either and I think you make so many great points here and congratulations on all of your accomplishments! In addition to the fact that most parents just can't teach as well as people with degrees and certificates in education, I think homeschooling really deprives students of the socialization they need to manage themselves and be successful as an adult. Social learning is almost as important as academic learning and taking that aspect of school away can be a real disadvantage to students who are otherwise very bright.

Got this big roll of toilet paper as a gag gift for Christmas. Whose laughing now!?,"Yes, folks, we are aware of the utterly unacceptable typo in this submission's title.

We won't be removing the post ‚Äì terrible writing is not a report-worthy offense, sadly ‚Äì but we will offer a lesson:

------

""Who's"" is the contraction meaning ""who is,"" whereas ""whose"" is possessive.

Remember, determiners ‚Äì words like its, his, hers, yours, mine, ours, theirs, and so on ‚Äì do not use apostrophes to show possession. The possessive quality is baked in, so to speak. This is why ""it's"" is a contraction, just like ""who's.""

While we're on the subject of apostrophes, it bears mentioning that they should almost never be used to pluralize. The only exceptions have to do with single letters (like when you get all A's in Imaginary Banana-Cultivation) or acronyms which employ both uppercase and lowercase letters (like when the RoUS's come to eat your imaginary bananas).

You should *never* use apostrophes to pluralize anything else, regardless of whether they're proper nouns (the plural of ""Jones"" is ""Joneses,"" and the plural of ""Jingleheimerschmidt"" is ""Jingleheimerschmidts""), dates (like when you write ""1980s"" or ""'80s,"" which is also a contraction), or standard nouns (like ""lessons in imaginary banana-cultivation""). You can find certain disreputable sources that might argue otherwise, but that should serve as a warning about said sources more than anything else.

------

There.

I hope you folks who issued those reports are happy... and I hope a few people learned something."

He said the lady brashly asked them to step aside so it wouldnt ruin her picture and he Stewart said ""by all means"" and stepped out of her way.  They had a pretty good laugh after she got her pic.

These people who set up a tent at an art fair," We can't bust heads like we used to. But we have our ways. One trick is to tell stories that don't go anywhere. Like the time I caught the ferry to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe. So I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. ""Gimme five bees for a quarter,"" you'd say. Now where were we... oh yeah. The important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have any white onions, because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones."
